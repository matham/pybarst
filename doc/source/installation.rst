Installation
=============

Drivers needs to be installed because barst loads them at  runtime, but only
on the computer running the server.

You can use `pybarst/tests/` to test individual channels types.

you ptovide the path where barsts exists to the server. When compiling you
need to provide path to cpl_defs.h if not in program files using
environ variable.

you just run make with mingw
